# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project showcases an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data, transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The analysis covers monthly revenue, pizza performance, peak sales times, and order frequency. The final dashboard, built in Excel , offers an interactive view with a slicer for monthly filtering and various visualizations to understand sales patterns.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the raw data using Excel and the Pandas library in Python.
2. **SQL Integration**: Imported the cleaned data into SQL, where queries were executed to validate and cross-check with Excel pivot table calculations.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with dynamic monthly sales analysis.

## Dashboard Insights

- **Monthly Revenue Analysis**: Track revenue for each month.
- **Top and Bottom Pizza Sales**: Identify which pizzas perform best and worst.
- **Peak Sales Times**: Analyze peak hours and days for orders.
- **Order Count**: View total orders within the selected month or overall period.

## Visualizations Used

- **Donut Chart**: Visualizes the revenue percentage contributed by each pizza type.
- **Funnel Chart**: Demonstrates order conversion rates to total revenue.
- **Bar Graph**: Highlights top and bottom pizzas based on sales performance.
- **Line Chart**: Shows monthly revenue trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and pivot table analysis.
- **Python (Pandas)**: Applied for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.
- **SQL**: Used to query data and verify accuracy against Excel results.
- **Excel**: Built an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the dataset and SQL scripts to recreate the analysis.
3. Run queries and load the dashboard in Power BI for a hands-on review of insights.

## Future Improvements

To expand this project, plans include:
- Publishing a README with additional documentation.
- Adding the dataset and SQL queries to GitHub for easy reference.
